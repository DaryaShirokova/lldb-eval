# On Windows clang.exe tries to find the MSVC toolchain by looking at environmental variables,
# querying Visual Studio instances via COM (>=2017) and reading Registry keys (<=2015).
# ProgramData data is typically required for COM api querying, unless a custom location for
# Visual Studio package cache is defined.
